# Skill Matching Application

## Problem Statement
There are loads of CRUD applications in the web, making another one would seem like a waste of time.
That is why, we've built this application to accomplish a more intresting objective.

The HR recruitment process takes a significant amount of time, preselecting and selecting candidates, assesing their skill level and eventually associating them to departements, to only find out, that sometimes we've made bad choices and have to restart the process all over again.

Sometimes, the choice relies solely on human criteria, leading to the lack of objectivity and automation and a huge waste of time; other times, the process is so automated and relies solely on coding games and a behavioural interview casting aside the candidate's potential.

## Proposed Solution
Therefore, this application solves that problem through incorporating most of the intresing criteria from all sides : soft and hard, and includes a final ranking where the human criteria could eventually interfere to make sense of the results and make the final choice.

This application, is built around another objective, it allows the recruiter to associate the best candidate for the best departement that fits his skills and profile, and that is through taking into consideraion a set  of primary and secondary skillset for each departement of his company, allocating scores for the candidate to each of the compentencies present in the company ( not only departement related ), and eventually, presenting the recruiter with a dashboard of ranked candidates for every single departement ( wether the candidate had that departement in mind or not ).
That way the company could propose a different departement where the candidate shines and he could consider it, thus, puttng the best man for the most fitting job.

The recruiter could introduce the set of departements of his company, the skillset : primary and secondary for each departement.
The recruiter will afterwards add candidates, their identifiers as well as their scores for all of the skills in the company.

The recruiter could then visulize the ranking results for the departements.

## How exactly does it solve the problem ? 
Through including a set of skills in various domains, various languages (technical), and various soft skills, or even other unrelated job skills that the company sees as significant and insightful, and allocating scores to them ( score allocation is dependant on the enterprise, it could arise from a test or other) a candidate's potential could be assessed objectively and wisely.

Furthermore, through, having scores for different skills, and labeling them as Necessary(primary) and supplementary(secondary) for each department, the formula for calculating the candidate's score, takes into account varying scores for each skill according to the departement, making that a very relevant KPI of the candidate's potential.

In addition to that, no candidate could have a vey useful skillset, but made an unconvenient choice of deprtement, he could be redirected to the departement where he will excell (accrding to KPI's calculations) and he will be presented with the opportunity to integrate your company !
