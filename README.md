# Dashboard-RH

There are loads of CRUD applications in the web, making another one would seem like a waste of time.
This application, is built around another objective, it allows the recruiter to associate the best candidate for the best departement that fits his skills and profile, and that is through taking into consideraion a set  of primary and secondary skillset for each departement of his company, allocating scores for the candidate to each of the compentencies present in the company ( not only departement related ), and eventually, presenting the recruiter with a dashboard of ranked candidates for every single departement ( wether the candidate had that departement in mind or not ).
That way the company could propose a different departement where the candidate shines and he could consider it, thus, puttng the best man for the most fitting job.

The recruiter could introduce the set of departements of his company, the skillset : primary and secondary for each departement.
The recruiter will afterwards add candidates, their identifiers as well as their scores for all of the skills in the company.

The recruiter could then visulize the ranking results for the departements.
